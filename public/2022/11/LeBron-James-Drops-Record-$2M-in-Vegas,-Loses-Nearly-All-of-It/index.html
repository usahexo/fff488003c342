<p>LeBron James made headlines over the weekend after he lost nearly all of the $2 million he had recently dropped in Vegas.</p>
<p>The news first came to light when James was spotted out and about in Los Angeles on Monday sporting a new, Louis Vuitton sweatsuit. When asked about his recent gambling losses, LeBron brushed it off as no big deal.</p>
<p>“I’m good. I’m fine,” LeBron told TMZ Sports. “It’s all good.”</p>
<p>Sources say that LeBron’s massive gambling loss came as a surprise to those close to him, as the 33-year-old has been playing extremely well both on and off the court lately. Just last week, LeBron led the Lakers to a win over the Golden State Warriors, one of the most impressive feats of his career.</p>
<p>Still, it seems that even LeBron James isn’t immune to bad luck every now and then. Let’s hope his next trip to Las Vegas is more successful!</p>
<h1 id="Tiger-Woods-Breaks-His-Own-Record-Loses-Over-1-5M-in-One-Night"><a href="#Tiger-Woods-Breaks-His-Own-Record-Loses-Over-1-5M-in-One-Night" class="headerlink" title="Tiger Woods Breaks His Own Record, Loses Over $1.5M in One Night"></a>Tiger Woods Breaks His Own Record, Loses Over $1.5M in One Night</h1><p>In one night, Tiger Woods lost more money than most people will make in a lifetime.</p>
<p>Woods is no stranger to losing money – his years-long divorce cost him an estimated $100 million – but this latest gamble may have set a new personal low for the golf champion.</p>
<p>According to reports, Woods placed a $1.5 million bet on the Houston Astros in their game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night. Unfortunately for Woods, the Astros lost, meaning Woods lost out on that investment as well.</p>
<p>This is just the latest in a string of bad luck for Woods, who has been struggling on the golf course over the past few years. In fact, Woods has not won a major tournament since 2008 and is currently ranked 682nd in the world.</p>
<p>While some may be tempted to write off Woods’ poor performance as simply due to old age, there is no doubt that his personal life is also taking its toll. In addition to his ongoing divorce battle, Woods was recently caught up in a scandal involving his recent extramarital affairs.</p>
<p>Despite all of these troubles, however, there is no question that Woods is still one of the greatest golfers of all time. With 14 major titles under his belt, he remains one of the most successful players ever to grace the green.</p>
<h1 id="Floyd-Mayweather-Jr-World-Record-Loss-of-7-8M-at-Casino"><a href="#Floyd-Mayweather-Jr-World-Record-Loss-of-7-8M-at-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Floyd Mayweather Jr. World-Record Loss of $7.8M at Casino"></a>Floyd Mayweather Jr. World-Record Loss of $7.8M at Casino</h1><p>On Saturday, August 26, 2017, boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. (40-0) walked into the sportsbook at the M Resort Spa Casino in Henderson, Nevada and placed a $1 million bet on the Atlanta Falcons to cover the 2.5-point spread against the Arizona Cardinals in their NFL preseason game later that day.</p>
<p>He also put down an additional $1 million bet on the Rams -3 against the Raiders, and another $500,000 on Philadelphia -2 against Buffalo. To everyone’s amazement, all three of his bets lost, resulting in a world-record gambling loss of $7.8 million.</p>
<p>Mayweather has been known as a savvy gambler over the years, winning and losing millions of dollars on various bets, so this recent debacle came as a bit of a surprise to many in the sports betting community. The only other time he’s come close to losing this much money was when he bet on Manny Pacquiao to win their 2015 megafight; Mayweather ultimately won that bout by unanimous decision but lost around $600,000 on the bet.</p>
<p>In any case, it will be interesting to see if Mayweather bounces back from this embarrassing loss or if it signals the beginning of the end for one of the greatest boxers of all time.</p>

A spokesman for Bloom said that the money was “a drop in the ocean” for the businessman, who is reportedly worth around £850 million.</p>
<p>Bloom made his fortune as a property developer and bookmaker. He is a major shareholder in Brighton &amp; Hove Albion Football Club, and also owns a number of luxury hotels and casinos.</p>
<p>The loss comes as a major blow to Bloom, who had been on a winning streak at the gambling tables in recent months. In February, he won nearly £3 million at the same casino in Monaco.</p>

<h1 id="Macau-Casinos-Win-Back-Over-3B-From-High-Rollers-in-First-Half-of-2017"><a href="#Macau-Casinos-Win-Back-Over-3B-From-High-Rollers-in-First-Half-of-2017" class="headerlink" title="Macau Casinos Win Back Over $3B From High-Rollers in First Half of 2017"></a>Macau Casinos Win Back Over $3B From High-Rollers in First Half of 2017</h1><p>According to figures released by the Macau government this week, casinos in the Special Administrative Region of Macau won back more than $3 billion from high-rollers in the first half of 2017. This was a significant increase on the same period last year, when casinos in Macau took in just over $2.5 billion from high-rollers.</p>
<p>This news will come as a relief to casino operators in Macau, who have been struggling in recent years as crackdowns by the Chinese government have led to a decline in visitation from mainland China. In response, casino operators have been increasingly focusing on wooing high-rollers from other parts of the world, and it seems that this strategy is beginning to pay off.</p>
<p>According to data from the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, casinos in Macau saw an increase of more than 10 percent in revenue from VIPs in the first half of 2017 when compared with the same period last year. This was driven primarily by an increase in revenue from Japanese and South Korean high-rollers.</p>
<p>The figures released this week show that casino operators are making a strong comeback, thanks largely to their efforts to attract high-rolling tourists from outside mainland China. However, it remains to be seen whether this trend can be sustained over the long term, or whether it is simply a result of temporary growth in other markets.</p>
