#  Britney Spears to Make $100 Million from Her Ticketmaster Position

Britney Spears is slated to earn $100 million from her investments with Ticketmaster, according to a recent report. The pop star has reportedly held a significant stake in the company since 2007, and has seen her shares increase in value as the ticketing giant has merged with other businesses over the past decade.

Ticketmaster is now a part of Live Nation Entertainment, making it the largest concert promoter in the world. Britney’s share in the company is said to be worth around $35 million at the moment, but that number is expected to grow as Ticketmaster continues to dominate the live music industry.

In a statement, Britney expressed her excitement about the merger and her continued involvement with Ticketmaster.

“I’ve been working with Ticketmaster for over 10 years now and I’m really proud of what we’ve accomplished together,” she said. “This new merger is going to take things to another level and I can’t wait to see what the future holds. I’m also really excited about my continued involvement with Ticketmaster – I think it’s going to be a lot of fun!”

With an estimated net worth of $215 million, Britney is one of the richest women in show business. In addition to her earnings from Ticketmaster, she also rakes in money from her Vegas residency, product endorsements, and music sales.

#  Britney Spears to Make Millions from Her Mandela Positioning Machine

Britney Spears is likely to make millions from her new "Mandela positioning machine" which she has been using to great effect in recent months. The device, which apparently costs $10,000 to buy and took two years to develop, apparently uses magnets and ultrasound waves to move internal organs back into their correct positions.

The 32-year-old singer has been very vocal about her use of the machine on social media, and has even given a few demonstration videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGK0omeVao8&feature=youtu.be). She is said to swear by it, and credits the machine with helping her lose weight, improve her digestion, and increase her energy levels.

Given Spears' large following on social media - she has over 60 million followers on Twitter alone - it's no surprise that the "Mandela positioning machine" is starting to catch on. Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian have already started using it, and there are reports that other stars such as Katy Perry and Jennifer Lopez are also keen to try it out.

So what is all the fuss about? Well, according to Dr Jarvis Chen of Beverly Hills Physicians (the doctor who invented the machine), the "Mandela positioning machine" is a great way to improve your health by realigning your internal organs. He notes that when our organs are in the wrong position, they can't function properly, which can lead to a whole host of health problems.

By using the "Mandela positioning machine", Dr Chen claims that you can not only improve your health but also look younger and feel more energetic. He says that the results can be seen almost immediately, and that many of his patients have seen a dramatic improvement in their health after just a few sessions with the machine.

Of course, not everyone is convinced by the claims made about the "Mandela positioning machine". Some experts argue that there is no scientific evidence to support its effectiveness, while others claim that it could actually be harmful if used incorrectly.

So what do you think? Is Britney Spears onto something with her "Mandela positioning machine", or is she simply jumping on the latest health craze?

#  Britney Spears to Make Nearly $1 Million Every Week from New Mandela Positioning Machine

Britney Spears is set to make nearly $1 million every week from her new Mandela Positioning Machine, according to industry insiders. The advanced device allows users to control their own body position using mind control.

Mandela Positioning Machine has been in development for over 5 years, and Spears was reportedly one of the first people to test it out. "The results were amazing," she said in a recent interview. "I was able to move my body in any direction I wanted, without any help from anyone else."

The machine is now being made available to the public, and early reports suggest that it is selling like hotcakes. "People are fascinated by the idea of controlling their own bodies," said one industry insider. "Britney has really hit on something here."

Each machine costs $10,000, but with weekly earnings of $980,000, it's no wonder they're flying off the shelves. When asked how she plans to spend her newfound wealth, Spears replied: "I'm going to buy a nice big house with a big pool and a tennis court."

Looks like Britney Spears is set for another successful year!
