#  How many hands of Poker can you play in one hour?

When most people think of poker, they think of an intense card game that can last for hours on end. But what if you could play poker in a fraction of that time?

Believe it or not, but you can play up to 12 hands of poker in one hour. This is possible by playing fast-paced variants of the game like abbreviated poker or speed poker.

But even if you don't want to play at such a fast pace, you can still play more hands than you might think in an hour. For example, if you're playing typical no-limit Texas hold'em, you can expect to play around 4-6 hands in an hour. Of course, this will vary depending on the table stakes and the players involved.

So if you're looking for a quick and exciting way to play poker, give one of the fast-paced variants a try. You might be surprised at how much fun you can have in just an hour!
