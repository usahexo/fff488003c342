#  Breaking down the blackjack chart JL Bourg

The blackjack chart is one of the most important tools for any blackjack player. This chart tells you the right play to make in any given situation. Knowing when to hit, stand, double down, or split is essential to playing blackjack well.

There are many different variations of the blackjack chart out there. However, they all have the same basic information. The following is a simplified explanation of the basic blackjack chart:

The first column shows you what hand you are dealt. The second column tells you what the dealer's up card is. The third column tells you what your options are based on the two hands.

For example, if you are dealt an 8 and the dealer has a 2 showing, then according to the blackjack chart, you should hit. If you are dealt an Ace and a 3, then according to the chart, you should double down.

#  How to maximize your wins at blackjack chart JL Bourg

When most people think about casino games, blackjack is one of the first that comes to mind. It’s popularity is largely due to its simplicity and the sense of accomplishment that comes with winning. But if you want to be a consistent winner when playing this game, you need to understand the basics and make use of a good blackjack chart.

The goal of blackjack is to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The card values are as follows: Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points. If you have drawn cards totaling 21, you automatically win the hand no matter what your opponent has.

The key to maximizing your wins at blackjack lies in making smart decisions about when to hit and when to stand. You can use a blackjack chart as a guide, but it’s important to keep in mind that each situation is unique and you should use your best judgement. Here are some general tips:

-Never hit on 12 or more – this is known as breaking your double down.

-Always hit on softer hands (a hand with fewer points) in order to try and get closer to 21.

-If you have 16 or less, always hit – even if the next card would give you 17 or more points. This is called staying on 16 or less.

-If you have 17 or more, you have a choice to make – either stand on your current total or hit and hope for better odds. If the next card would give you over 21 points (called busting), then you automatically lose the hand even if your opponent has also busted.
