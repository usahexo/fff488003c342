#  What are the differences between playing roulette on the 1x2 Network and at a terrestrial casino?

When it comes to playing roulette, there are plenty of choices out there as to where you can do so. You can either visit a terrestrial casino, or alternatively participate in an online casino. The two options have quite a few similarities and differences that should be considered before making a decision on where to play.

The first and most obvious difference between terrestrial casinos and online ones is that the former can only be accessed in physical locations, whereas the latter can be accessed from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. This means that if you live in a country where traditional gambling is not allowed, you can still partake in online gambling without breaking any laws. It also means that you don't have to waste time travelling to a casino, which can save you both money and time.

Another big difference between terrestrial casinos and online ones is the variety of games available. Terrestrial casinos typically only offer a limited number of games, while online casinos offer a much wider selection. This is because online casinos have to compete with one another to attract players, while terrestrial casinos don't need to worry about this as they generally have a captive audience due to the lack of alternatives.

The third big difference between terrestrial casinos and online ones is the stakes that are available. In general, the stakes are much higher at terrestrial casinos than they are at online ones. This is because online casinos have smaller overheads than terrestrial ones, meaning they can afford to offer lower stakes without losing money. Additionally, some online casinos offer bonuses for signing up or for making deposits, which allows players to gamble with larger sums of money than they would be able to at a terrestrial casino.

The final big difference between terrestrial casinos and online ones is the payout rates. Online casinos tend to payout more than terrestrial ones, largely because there is more competition amongst them which drives up the payouts (this also applies to the bonus amounts offered). This means that if you're looking to maximise your chances of winning then playing roulette at an online casino is your best bet.
